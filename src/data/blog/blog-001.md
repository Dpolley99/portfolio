# A Non-Linear Path Into Software

I did not begin my career with the intention of becoming a software engineer.

My academic training was in mechanical engineering, where I learned to think in terms of systems, constraints, and trade-offs. During that period, I worked on a project that later became *Barodont*—a wearable dental device designed to prevent barodontalgia. Being a named inventor on a granted patent was less about recognition and more about seeing an idea move from concept to something tangible and defensible.

After engineering, my work moved in a very different direction.

## From Engineering to Markets

I spent time working as an investment consultant, analysing markets, capital allocation, and risk. The work was analytical and abstract in a different way—less physical, more probabilistic. What interested me most was not prediction, but structure: how incentives, systems, and constraints shape outcomes over time.

Looking back, that phase sharpened how I think about trade-offs, uncertainty, and second-order effects—skills that turned out to be transferable in unexpected ways.

## Why Software Made Sense

Software development emerged gradually, not as a sudden pivot.

What drew me in was the combination of design, logic, and execution. Software sits at a point where ideas can be tested quickly, systems can be iterated on, and decisions have immediate consequences. It felt like a natural convergence of my earlier experiences rather than a departure from them.

I began building small projects, then larger ones—learning by assembling things end to end rather than focusing on isolated concepts.

## Where I Am Now

At present, my work is largely frontend-focused, using TypeScript, JavaScript, and React, often integrating APIs and backend services. I am increasingly conscious of structure, testing, and reliability, and I’ve started incorporating automated testing and basic CI/CD workflows as my projects become more production-oriented.

I still consider myself early in this field. That is not something I’m trying to hide or rush past.

## Why I’m Writing Here

This blog exists to document how systems are built, broken, and refined over time—both technical systems and personal ones. Some posts will be technical, others reflective. The common thread is learning through building.

This first post is simply context.

The rest will be about the work.
