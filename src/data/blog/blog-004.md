## The Problem No One Notices—Until It Becomes Unavoidable

Barodontalgia is a condition defined by acute dental pain triggered by changes in ambient pressure. It affects individuals exposed to altitude or pressure variation—pilots, divers, and frequent flyers among them. While clinically recognised, it remains largely absent from public awareness and is typically addressed only after symptoms appear.

Preventive solutions are rare. Treatment, when it exists, is largely reactive. That gap—between a known problem and the absence of practical prevention—formed the basis of *Barodont*.

## Origin of the Idea

The clinical insight behind Barodont did not originate with me.

The first inventor, **Dr. Adwitia Sukanya Bhattacharyya**, now a practising dentist, and also, my dentist, identified the problem through her medical training and experience. She articulated the condition clearly, defined its implications, and framed it as a solvable challenge rather than an inevitability.

I joined the project as the sole **non-medical contributor**, with a background in **Mechanical Engineering**. That distinction shaped my role and, ultimately, the way the solution took form.

## An Engineering Perspective on a Medical Problem

Lacking clinical expertise, I approached the project not through diagnosis or treatment, but through **systems and constraints**.

My responsibility was to translate a medical requirement into an engineering solution—one that could exist in the real world. This involved:

- Conceptual and mechanical design  
- Prototyping and iteration  
- Material considerations and form-factor decisions  
- Early-stage quality and feasibility checks  

Rather than focusing on symptoms, I treated the problem as a system: the human body, the environment, and a wearable device interacting under pressure variation. Every design decision had to justify itself in terms of comfort, repeatability, and practicality.

Being outside the medical domain forced a level of clarity that proved valuable. Assumptions were interrogated. Simplicity was prioritised. The device had to work—not merely make sense on paper.

## Designing Under Constraint

The most demanding phase of the project occurred under circumstances that were far from ideal.

In **mid to late May 2021**, while actively working on the core design, I contracted **COVID-19**. At the time, my entire family was also affected. Despite this, the project timeline remained fixed. The first formal presentation was scheduled for **September 2021**, which meant the design needed to be finalised within days, not weeks.

Work continued through illness—not out of urgency alone, but out of responsibility to the team. Progress was incremental and deliberate. Decisions were made carefully, even when physical capacity was limited. The design reached a presentable, defensible state within the required window.

That period shaped how I approach work to this day: prioritising focus, discipline, and follow-through even when conditions are imperfect.

## Execution and Recognition

By the time the project was evaluated, it had moved beyond the expectations of a standard academic submission. The solution was coherent, grounded, and executable.

During the final review, members of the judging panel independently recommended that the design be considered for patenting. That external validation reframed the project—from coursework to potential intellectual property.

## From Application to Granted Patent

Following institutional encouragement, we proceeded with the patent process in **January 2022**. What followed was a long and exacting process, requiring precision in documentation, clarity of claims, and sustained engagement.

In **January 2024**, the patent for *Barodont* was formally granted.

## Why Barodont Still Matters

Although my professional focus has since shifted toward software development, Barodont remains a defining experience.

It taught me how to:
- Design under real-world constraints  
- Translate abstract requirements into defensible systems  
- Execute consistently despite uncertainty and disruption  
- See ideas through extended timelines, not just initial enthusiasm  

More importantly, it revealed a pattern that continues to guide my work: a preference for **preventive thinking**, disciplined execution, and building systems that hold up under pressure.

Different domains. The same principles.

## Closing Reflection

Barodont was a collaborative effort rooted in clinical insight and realised through engineering discipline. It stands as an example of what can emerge when expertise crosses boundaries—and when resilience is treated not as a headline, but as a quiet constant.
