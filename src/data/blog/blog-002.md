# Learning to Code by Breaking Things

My introduction to coding was not elegant.

I started with HTML and CSS, following along with SuperSimpleDev’s material, and then moved into JavaScript. At the time, most of it did not fully make sense. I could type the code, but I did not yet understand why it worked—or why it broke when I changed something.

That gap between imitation and understanding defined the early phase of my learning.

## The First Real Friction: JavaScript

When I began working through Frontend Mentor challenges, the difference became clear.  
The HTML and CSS tasks felt manageable and relatively quick. The moment JavaScript entered the picture, progress slowed dramatically.

I found myself:
- Rewatching tutorials multiple times
- Reading other developers’ solutions
- Comparing different approaches to the same problem
- Choosing one path and attempting my own implementation

Even then, bugs were constant. Some I could reason through and fix. Others required external help—from Stack Overflow, and later from AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude. I did not treat those as answers to copy, but as ways to understand *why* my approach was failing.

Progress during this phase was uneven, but it was real.

## Moving Into React

Once I became more comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals, I started my first React project.

The tutorial I followed used React 19 and Tailwind CSS v3.4. I chose to work with Tailwind CSS v4 instead, which immediately forced me off the tutorial path. Things did not install the same way, and certain defaults had changed.

This was my first real exposure to reading documentation rather than following instructions.

I had to:
- Understand what had changed between versions
- Adjust configuration manually
- Verify assumptions rather than rely on examples

It was slow, but it worked. More importantly, it shifted how I approached learning new tools.

## Expanding the Surface Area

The next project involved React Router DOM. By that point, the React environment felt familiar enough that I could focus on composition and behavior rather than syntax. I also experimented with libraries like Scroll Parallax, which introduced new concerns around layout, rendering, and user experience.

The complexity increased, but it felt additive rather than overwhelming.

## A Failed Attempt at Full Stack

My first attempt at building a full-stack application using the MERN stack did not go well.

I struggled to understand how the backend pieces fit together, how data flowed through the system, and how responsibilities were divided across layers. The mental overhead was too high, and progress stalled.

Rather than forcing it, I stepped back.

That failure made one thing clear: I needed a smoother bridge between frontend and backend concepts.

## Why I’m Looking at Next.js Next

Before returning to a full MERN setup, I plan to work with Next.js.

From discussions with other developers, the appeal is not simplicity in the abstract, but structure:
- A clearer default architecture
- Built-in routing and data-fetching patterns
- Reduced configuration overhead
- A more cohesive mental model for full-stack applications

It lowers the number of decisions required upfront, which makes it easier to focus on understanding how the system works as a whole.

## Where This Leaves Me

Learning to code has been less about steady progress and more about repeated friction—followed by small breakthroughs. Failures have not been detours; they have been part of the process.

This post is not a guide. It is a record.

The next ones will likely be more specific, more technical, and occasionally just as uncomfortable.
