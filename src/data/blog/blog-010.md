## A Non-Linear Path

My journey into technology was neither direct nor inevitable. I began as a mechanical engineering student, later worked in an investment and consulting-oriented role, and only then transitioned into tech. Each phase taught me something valuable, but none felt entirely complete on its own.

Mechanical engineering trained me to think structurally—to respect systems, constraints, and cause-and-effect relationships. Finance and investment consulting sharpened my analytical thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, and appreciation for long-term value creation. Yet despite the rigour of both fields, something remained unresolved.

## Discovering Tech as a Medium

Technology entered my life not as a grand career pivot, but as a tool for problem-solving. What drew me in was not just the act of coding, but the immediacy of feedback—ideas could be tested, broken, rebuilt, and improved rapidly.

Unlike my previous experiences, tech allowed me to:
- Combine analytical thinking with creative execution  
- Build tangible systems independently  
- Continuously refine my understanding through practice  

For the first time, learning felt iterative rather than sequential.

## Why I Chose to Stay

Many people can explore tech briefly. Staying, however, requires a deeper alignment.

I chose to stay in tech because it rewards **curiosity, patience, and compounding effort**. Progress is rarely instant, but it is cumulative. Each concept learned meaningfully improves the next decision you make. Each mistake sharpens judgement.

More importantly, tech offered a sense of ownership over my growth. The responsibility for improvement rested largely with me—and I found that motivating rather than intimidating.

## A Shift in Perspective

What changed over time was not just my skill set, but my mindset. I stopped viewing technology as something to “learn quickly” and began treating it as a craft—one that demands humility, discipline, and long-term commitment.

Looking back, the non-linear nature of my journey no longer feels like a disadvantage. It gave me context, perspective, and respect for complexity. Staying in tech was not about abandoning previous paths, but about integrating what they taught me into a field where continuous learning is not optional, but essential.

That is why I stayed.
